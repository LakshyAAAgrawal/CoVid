## Aim
To provide an environment for easy recording of university lectures and presentations, with a priority to reducing the recorded session file size.

Many students in our university face issues with attending online lectures(during the Covid pandemic and otherwise), mainly due to poor internet connectivity. They were not even able to download the large recorded lecture files. Through CoVid(Co - Video), we aim to reduce the recorded lecture file size. People even with bad internet coverage are able to download the small files easily and view the lecture recordings.
